## Demo of deployed app:
![Demo]()

## Description:
```
This application uses MVC architecture to produce a tech orientated blog website, 
with a fully functioning backend. Users can create, read, update and delete their own blog posts, 
which is made possible by a server-side api and database.

Sequelize npm is used to facilitate table creation and entity relationships. Express npm
takes care of the server-side routing and acts as the middleware between the routes/controllers
and the front-end views. 

Handlebars is used to dynamically inject HTML and to update page content accordingly.
